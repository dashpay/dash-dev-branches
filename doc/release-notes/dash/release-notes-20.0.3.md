# Upgrading and downgrading

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < v19.2.0

Downgrading to a version older than v19.2.0 is not supported due to changes
in the evodb database. If you need to use an older version, you must either
reindex or re-sync the whole chain.

# Notable changes

## Masternode fix

The memory usage during the old quorum data cleanup mechanism was reduced.

## Wallet fix

A fix has been implemented for the reported decryption of wallets.

## RPC changes

In `getspecialtxes` `instantlock` and `chainlock` fields are reflecting actual values now.

## Other changes

Implemented improvements in Github CI and build system for macOS. Fixed compilation issues on FreeBSD.
